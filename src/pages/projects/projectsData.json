        "paragraph": "Trajectories of moving objects are usually modeled as sequences of space-time points or, in case of semantic trajectories, as labeled stops and moves. Data analytics methods on these kinds of trajectories tend to discover geometrical and temporal patterns, or simple semantic patterns based on the labels of stops and moves. A recent extension of semantic trajectories is called multiple aspects trajectory, i.e., a trajectory associated to different semantic dimensions called aspects. This kind of trajectory increases in a large scale the number of discovered patterns."
      },
      {
        "paragraph": "This project introduced the concept of dependency rule to represent patterns discovered from the analysis of trajectories with multiple aspects. They included patterns related to a trajectory, trajectory points, or the moving object. These rules are conceptually represented as an extension of a conceptual model for multiple aspects trajectories. A case study shows that the proposal is relevant as it represents the discovered rules with a concise but expressive conceptual model. Additionally, a performance evaluation showed the feasibility of the conceptual model designed over relational-based database management technologies."

Using the “OLTPBenchmark” tool, I implemented some query settings for PostgreSQL and VoltDB databases, and tested the performance of both with different amounts of data. The focus was to have a performance comparison between a NewSQL DBMS and an SQL DBMS."

Signed electronic documents permeate various aspects of society, such as contracts between entities, medical prescriptions, legal documents and invoices, and providing professional assistance in a fully digitized environment poses a series of challenges, among which stand out the need to guarantee the authenticity, integrity and veracity of documents used by service providers and their consumers."

Teleworking, combined with the technologies used to make this modality possible, provides and enables the provision of assistance in remote or difficult-to-access environments. It is observed that there is currently limited support for the practice of telecommuting in certain institutions. Thus, it is important to encourage research in this line, to study the issuance of signed receipts, particularly standardized methods to allow the creation of an artifact that enables the user to prove that, at a certain point, a digitally signed document was subjected to a digital signature verification service, makes it possible to provide solutions that serve society in general."

In the beginning, I worked in the research area, looking for a way to implement the validation API in an application for mobile devices, I started trying to use OpenSSL to validate attribute certificates offline in the application (which was implemented in Flutter with the implementation of the validator in the application having been done in Java), but at the time OpenSSL did not have enough support to make the validator work correctly, so a different way had to be found."
